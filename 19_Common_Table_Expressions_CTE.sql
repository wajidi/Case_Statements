   SQL Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This script demonstrates the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL Server.
   It includes examples of non-recursive CTEs for data aggregation and segmentation,
   as well as recursive CTEs for generating sequences and building hierarchical data.
